                                    As the Product Manager at Brooi, my role was something in between product management and project management. I was responsible for managing product development process, writing user stories, requirements, and acceptance criteria, and working closely with the development team to ensure that the product meets the needs of our users. I was also responsible for some scrum master duties, such as sprint planning, daily standups, and sprint retrospectives. On some days, I work as the scrum master, some days as the product manager, and some days as the QA tester. Due to the nature of the company as a startup, I did many things that were not in my job description, but I enjoyed the experience and learned a lot from it.

                                    Brooi is a core technology product built with Vue.js for the frontend and GraphQL for the backend. We used AWS for hosting and storage. Brooi&apos;s payment system is powered by Paystack. I got my strong knowledge of ClickUp from Brooi as we used it for project management. We also used GitHub for version control and collaboration.

                                    One of the biggest challenges I faced at Brooi was setting up a project management process that works for the team. We had a small team of developers (I was the first PM), and we were just starting to work remotely (we used to work in a workspace). I had to create a Clickup workspace, create a Slack workspace for communication and started managing the project using Agile methodologies. I also had to learn how to write user stories, requirements, and acceptance criteria, and how to work with the development team to ensure that the product meets the needs of our users. It was a steep learning curve, but I was able to overcome the challenges and deliver features and improvements to the product.

                                    Brooi is a product that I am proud of. We were able to build a solid product that is viable. We were able get the product ready for market after so much iterations. We built a solid team that is able to work remotely and deliver on time.

                                    Building Brooi was a great learning experience for me. I learned a lot about product management, project management, and working with a remote team. I also learned a lot about the travel and tourism industry, and how to build a product that meets the needs of our users.
